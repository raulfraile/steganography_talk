# Steganography talk extra materials

In this repository you can find examples and demos used in my talk about [Steganography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography).

## Examples

### Piet

[Piet](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html) is a programming language in which programs look like abstract paintings.

Most examples are from the [Piet samples page](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet/samples.html). The Fibonacci example is from [Progopedia](http://progopedia.com/example/fibonacci/375/).

### Polyglot

[Original gist](https://gist.github.com/SaswatPadhi/2872457) of the polyglot example.

### Whitespace

[Whitespace]() is an esoteric programming language with only three lexical tokens: Space (ASCII 32), Tab (ASCII 9) and Line Feed (ASCII 10). 

All examples were taken from the [igorw/whitespace-php](https://github.com/igorw/whitespace-php) repository.
